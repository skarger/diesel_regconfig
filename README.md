## Intro

This repo exists to demonstrate how to support a Postgres-specific column type, `regconfig` in [Diesel](http://diesel.rs/).

The `regconfig` type relates to the Postgres [Full Text Search](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch.html) feature.

It represents the natural language of a searchable text document, like `english`.

When querying a database with a client like `psql`, the values of `regconfig` columns
basically appear as strings. Given a `ts_config_name` column of type `regconfig`,
a query would look like this:

```shell script
SELECT id, ts_config_name FROM regconfigs;

ID  TS_CONFIG_NAME
1   english
2   spanish
```

However, unlike arbitrary strings, the only valid values are the identifiers
for languages supported in your database.

In fact, `regconfig` is one of several aliases
for a Postgres [Object Identifier](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-oid.html).
As it states on those Postgres docs,
> The oid type is currently implemented as an unsigned four-byte integer.

This is relevant to the Diesel implementation, as it means that we are not
reading text from the DB, but rather `u32` values.

When the Diesel code translates the DB values into Rust values,
it can use any Rust type, for example `String`. Yet since the valid `regconfig`
values are a finite set of `OIDs` representing language identifiers,
a Rust `Enum` is a good choice.

The challenge is how to represent a `regconfig` column in Diesel:
* How to represent it in the Diesel `schema.rs` and `models.rs` modules.
* How to serialize and deserialize it.
* How to query and insert it from Rust code.

## Project structure

First, we have a Diesel migration to create an example table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE regconfigs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    ts_config_name REGCONFIG NOT NULL DEFAULT 'english'
);
```

After running this migration, `schema.rs` will look like this:

```rust
table! {
    regconfigs (id) {
        id -> Int4,
        ts_config_name -> Regconfig,
    }
}
```

However, the generated `Regconfig` reference is invalid - this code will not compile:

```shell script
error[E0412]: cannot find type `Regconfig` in this scope
 --> src/schema.rs:4:27
  |
4 |         ts_config_name -> Regconfig,
  |                           ^^^^^^^^^ not found in this scope
```

Commenting that line in `schema.rs` will allow the project to compile.
Of course then it's impossible to reference that column from Rust code.

Taking the `Enum` approach, I can define the *Rust* type like so:

```rust
    #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, FromSqlRow, AsExpression)]
    #[sql_type = "Regconfig"]
    pub enum RegConfigEnum {
        English,
        Spanish,
    }
```

Notice the `#[sql_type = "Regconfig"]` macro. This refers to the custom SQL type
we define so that the Diesel-created `schema.rs` will have a valid reference:

```rust
    #[derive(SqlType)]
    #[postgres(type_name = "regconfig")]
    pub struct Regconfig;
```

Assuming that we define the above in `src/types.rs`, we must tell `diesel cli`
to include it when dumping the schema:

```toml
import_types = ["diesel::sql_types::*", "crate::types::*"]
```

To make these types work, we must also implement the serialization/deserialization.
See `src/types.rs` for details.

## How to Install

At the time of creating this repo, the current `diesel` version is `1.4.2`.

Locally I am using Postgres 11.2, although any version that supports [Full Text Search](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch.html) should work for this demo.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Change the `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file if you wish, then:

```
diesel setup
```

```
diesel migration run
```
